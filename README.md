# Mask-Detection-System

Mask Detection System
This project is a COVID-19 Mask Detection System developed using Google Teachable Machine, Python, and a Raspberry Pi. It was designed to automate gate access based on mask compliance. The system uses a machine learning model to classify individuals into three categories:
	•	No mask or face not covered properly
	•	Face covered but not wearing any mask
	•	Wearing a proper mask
The project was deployed in my school to ensure compliance with COVID-19 safety protocols, making it a practical application of machine learning in real-world scenarios.
Features
	•	Machine Learning Model: Built using Google Teachable Machine for image classification.
	•	Integration with Raspberry Pi: Enables real-time detection and automated gate control.
	•	COVID-19 Safety Compliance: Ensures only individuals wearing masks are granted access.
Deployment
This project was primarily developed and deployed in my school as part of a practical learning initiative. While the full system is no longer available, the trained machine learning model is preserved and can be reused or extended for similar applications.
Available Files
	•	`model.json`: The trained machine learning model.
	•	`metadata.json`: Metadata for the model, including labels and configurations.
Note
Since most of this project was implemented during school, only the model files are available. The hardware setup and integration details are not included in this repository.
